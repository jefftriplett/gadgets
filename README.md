# :control_knobs: gadgets

This repo tracks interesting products that I find and like. 

- [Wyze Cam Outdoor](https://wyze.com/wyze-cam-outdoor.html): Wyze cameras are small and work surprisingly well for being cheap. 
- [8BitDo](https://www.8bitdo.com/) I love their controls, yet I own none of them. I want to buy them all though, but I don't play games enough to justify it. 
- [Analagoue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket/) - They built a better GameBoy. This is also on my list of cool gadgets that if I owned, I'd never use. It's so shiny though.
