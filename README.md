# :control_knobs: gadgets

This repo tracks interesting products that I find and like. 

- [Wyze Cam Outdoor](https://wyze.com/wyze-cam-outdoor.html): Wyze cameras are small and work surprisingly well for being cheap. 
- [8BitDo](https://www.8bitdo.com/) I love their controls, yet I own none of them. I want to buy them all though, but I don't play games enough to justify it. 
- [Analagoue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket/) - They built a better GameBoy. This is also on my list of cool gadgets that if I owned, I'd never use. It's so shiny though. 
- [HooToo USB C Hub](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01K7C53K2/) - It's cheap and works with a 4K monitor plus has: 3 x USB-3 ports, an SD Card Reader, and a 100W charging port. I gave ~$17 for mine.
- [MavisLink Audio Video Capture Cards HDMI to USB 1080p USB2.0](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B087C3NG9W/) - This was cheap and just worked without any drivers or fancy features. 
- [Brother Compact Monochrome Laser Printer](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0763WDSYZ/) - A cheap black and white WiFi printer.
- [Philips Hue Play White & Color Smart Light, 2 Pack Base kit](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GXB3S7Z/) - This was a COVID-19 buy that help add some color to my office. I already had a used Philips Hue Hub. 
- [Reflex Lab Extra Large Extended Gaming Mouse Pad Mat XXXL](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CPX9RCQ/) - This was another COVID-19 purchase which stemmed from me wishing my entire desk was one huge mouse pad. It's great. 
- [Elgato Cam Link 4K](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K3FN5MR/)
- [ELEGOO UNO R3 Board](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EWOE0UU/) - I used this Arduino board to emulate a Switch controller so I could bot BOTW's Snow Bowling game. 

## Audio

- [Mpow Bluetooth 5.0 Transmitter Receiver, 2 in 1 Bluetooth Audio Adapter](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B081B3DGKH/) - This device works great and it's a wonderful multi-tasker tool. It's battery powered and can both transmit or receive audio via a 1/8" jack.
- [Plantronics Calisto 610-M Portable USB Speakerphone](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SLP4VQK/) - Most of the time, I use a fancy mic for calls, but this Plantronics speakerphone is great for longer meetings or group meetings. The sounds and mic work great and it feels like everyone is in the room with me.
- [Anker Soundcore Life Q20 Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NM3RSRQ/) - These were the right price range and work really well. I spend most of my week with these on whether I am in a call or not.
